# get-things-done

### Click [here](https://ebregains.github.io/get-things-done/) to the project.

## Introduction

This is the first project I worked on. It was a simple to-do list that I made to learn about React and their hooks, DOM manipulation and project structures. I also learned about the importance of planning and how to structure a project.

## The project

Easy and plain ToDo tracker. One can add, remove, and complete tasks. The tasks can be categorized as "normal", "important", "urgent" or "important and urgent", and this will make them appear higher or lower on the list, prioritizing urgency over importance. 

One can toggle the "important" and the "urgent" tag by clicking on them, or just by using on of these shortcuts while writing the todo (without the quotes)

-"$i" for important
-"$u" for urgent
-"$$ui" or "$$iu" to add both

So no needance to put your hands out of the keyboard!

Everything will be stored on your LocalStorage, so your list is going to stay there after you close the page, but is not going to stay across devices (yet). Enjoy!
